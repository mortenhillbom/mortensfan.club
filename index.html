<p>Hey!</p>
<p>My project consists of to parts: A Pebble app you can download <a href="files/ForgetMeNot.pbw">here</a>, and an Android companion app you can download <a href="files/ForgetMeNot.apk">here</a>.<br>
	After you have installed both, open the Android app and then the watchapp should open automatially (but it may take a little while, <br> so just open it if you're eager). Then all you have to do is meet someone, say your name cleary, shake their hand firmly (like you always should) and then he, or she hopefully will tell you
	their name. Confirm with one click at the Pebble after the conversation is over, and it should all be registered at the app (the records is not saved permanently yet, so if you force quit the app, or it's unused for a long while the records will be deleted, just sayin'). </p>
